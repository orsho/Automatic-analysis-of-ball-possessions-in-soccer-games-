Nowadays soccer ball possession is computed manually by the sum of passes for each team
divided by the game total passes to produce a percentage of ball possession.
This method has been found correlated with the actual ball possession of most games but not in
teams that make a lot of passes during the game like Barcelona.
In this project, we are trying to measure it automatically by classifying which team possesses
the ball in each frame, based on computer vision techniques.
There are numerous challenges in this problem, including: changing grass colors and
illumination, moving camera, occlusions, small soccer ball, interfering field marks in the color of
the ball, ball moving at different directions and speed, ball shape distortion at frames due to high
speed, ball changing size with respect to distance from the camera and more.
